**Projects Overview**


*Python Arcade Shooter*

This classic side-scrolling game combines platform and run-and-gun elements. Players navigate platforms, dodging goblin attacks while firing back. Four levels offer increasing difficulty, with a respawn feature sending players back to the start upon death. An autosave feature allows players to store up to nine save games, ensuring progress is preserved.


*Therapist Chatbox*

A text-based AI application offering supportive conversations for users to express emotions and discuss mental health anonymously. It provides customizable responses, resource recommendations, and progress tracking features.
